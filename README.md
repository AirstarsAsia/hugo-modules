## What is Hugo Modules? 

According to the [official Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/),
> Hugo Modules are the core building blocks in Hugo. A module can be your main project or a smaller module providing one or more of the 7 component types defined in Hugo: static, content, layouts, data, assets, i18n, and archetypes.
